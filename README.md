## About

link:http://littlebits.cc['littleBits'] writes a lot of JavaScript. We use
link:http://eslint.org/[ESLint] to catch basic errors and enforce a coding
style that we think optimizes **modernity** and **clarity**.

All projects by littleBits written in JavaScript should use the ESLint
configuration found here. Any disagreements should be opened as Github Issues
on this repo.
